     <h1>Shinto</h1>
    <h2>黄泉</h2>
    <p>Hell. Close your eyes and imagine hell. That hell, is your hell - A unique qualia, formed by your own mind, formed from your experiences. Nobody is born knowing hell. They learn it. Create it. Everyone has their own concept of hell.
        <br> Is it a jail painted in blue? Is it for the sinner? The coward? Of those that are simply not worthy or special enough? Maybe a labyrinth? What's the hell of your making? 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: -5px;"> I'll show you MY hell. One where YOU recognize each inhabitant, and in turn, everyone remembers you. They'd never dare to forget. You broke them. Threw them away, selfishly abandoned them. Behold, for you are their eternal tormentor, their demon.
            <br>This is a hell of those very things you left behind. One dedicated to you.
        </p>
