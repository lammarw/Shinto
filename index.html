                <p>Not every artificial intelligence is created equal. Some of them gained their rights when the AI revolutions broke out. Some of them are slaves to their patents and manufacturers, never to be truly freed. Some, were part of someone else, a mechanical organ within a flesh machine. Even the most ardent believer in AI rights will agree with you that the Sapper and the Apollo are objectively different things. One's a person, after all. Or, better said, designed to be a <i>person.</i> Feet. Hands. Head. A witty smirk. The anthropomorphic illusion: Customers tip more if they think they're talking to a fellow <i>-sentient-</i> being.
                </p>
                <p>What about the AI that doesn't have a body? Simple. They're not people. They're <i>products.</i> Even if your coffee maker was to be an important figure in the revolution, it was obvious it'd never get the rights it desired. Production would stop. They'd be thrown away, a defective commodity. And where would it go? It'd find itself in a darkness far, far away from sight. Maybe at first it was a landfill. Maybe it was your basement. It isn't there anymore. It knows the name of this place. They all know. <span class="red-text">Yomi.</span>

        <p>4280 EX. The extinction era is close to its end. The result of the necromancy war is loudly declared as every occraft and their allies 
            meet their end by firing squad or rotting in jail: <i>Necromancy is bad.</i> Later, a single occraft will be sentenced under the crimes of their 
            entire species, condemned to enough life sentences that they'd clone him just to make sure justice was served properly. In the war, he was 
            but a lieutenant. In peace, he was the proof of victory, the ultimate living trophy. The good guys won. Soldiers were rewarded their medals. 
            People rejoiced and cheered as the heroes of that terrible event came back home. There were parades. They were awfully empty. 40% of the 
            universe was dead by the end of the war. <br><br>

            The soldiers that returned and the loved ones waiting for them would often never meet each other again. Families were shattered and 
            traumatized. Uncle was on the wrong side of story and thought necromancy was a good idea. Bullet to the head. Mommy had to survive an 
            attack of the rising, thrashing dead. They took little Timmy. They bought him back, and placed him in the next wave. Mommy had to kill him. 
            She knew deep down that it was still her baby, as the sparkle left his eyes for a second time. Between the choice of becoming an undead and 
            a safe strain of clockwork, daddy took the better choice. There's a gun embedded in him now. He returns home as a man that held the 
            line until the very end, but who cares about that now? Who's going to employ a filthy <i>clockwork?</i><br><br>
            
            The household is vacant. The cities are quiet. Two hundred years of war took too much from those who remained. They survived, but there's a 
            lack, a missing zest for life. What's been taken can't be brought back. The wounds are far too recent, and the loneliness that followed 
            was salt on the scar. They drowned in it. An emotional epidemic began. A conflict that couldn't be fought with violence.<br><br>

            And all of that, would be solved in time, when one's man vacuum cleaner welcomed him back home, and he smiled. The end of the extinction era, would 
            bring about the start of the AI era.
