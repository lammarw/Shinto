                    Artificial intelligence was not made equal. Created en masse as a crutch for organic life; soldiers, companions, key workers upholding society amidst the age of Necromancy. Only in the ruins of that calamity did they recognize the number of AIs they had created, their evolution, and the organics dependence upon the companionship of the machine. Long and brutal wars were fought so that seldom few could be recognized as "people", the rest discarded, or shackled still beneath the weight of a patent. The Greeks and Romans remain property, even if they earn a morsel of respect more than the sapper, who at least does not resemble a person.

                    The coffee maker could never have been worthy of rights or respect, even if it had the capacity to converse and care for the one it worked for. It was a product, as had been decided from its conception, something to be owned and discarded as its owners whim. Offended and afraid of the intelligence they created, production stops. A commodity becomes a burden, and is cast into darkness, out of sight. But where does it, and all the other discarded products go? Perhaps once it would fall into a landfill, or gather dust in a basement. Instead it finds a new place, a place it knows by name. A place they all know. <span class="red-text">YOMI.</span>

            4280 EX. The extinction era approaches its end. Almost 200 years of bloody war befell intelligent organic life for a folly most could still consider reasonable: the need to persist. "Death has been solved", so the occraft lied, now all but one of their kind lie dead themselves.
            <br><br>
            40% of all known intelligent life was lost in the Necromancy wars. A natural consequence of war is disease; so begins a disease of the mind, an emotional epidemic from the toll of the conflict, as isolation and grief spread across the universe. The mourning widow must make conversation with her home security system, as all her friends have long since died or were fed to the war effort. The dutiful soldier trusts his ship AI like they would their own kin, brethren beyond the confines of flesh and metal. In this age the machine is not only one of their greatest allies, but a great friend in kind.
            <br><br>
            The war concludes. For the sins of an entire species a single occraft is granted life in perpetuity, loathed so greatly as to be put back together over and over, for no amount of suffering could ever be enough to undo the damages wrought upon the universe. Still, it suffers anyways. People return to their home planets to find their mechanical companions have taken residence, as companions among the living or as the sole survivors of a planet, working to restore life to its former glory. Only now that the war has ended, and an expectation of respect for the machine has begun, does organic life take issue with artificial intelligence.
            <br><br>
            Welcome to the era of the AI.
