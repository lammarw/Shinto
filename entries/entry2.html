            <h3 style="color: white;">The world's sharpest blade...</h3>
            <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p style="color: white;">The Susanoo line of kitchen knives was unique within its market, known for being the first model to integrate AI into its operation (soon to be followed by AI forks, a Shinto representative once joked to the press). Helpful and friendly, the Susanoo came pre-installed with a number of recipes and cooking tips, as well as offering nutritional information on the food that passed under its blade, and was sold as a valuable companion for beginners still learning how to cook. Most prominently advertised, however, was the other point that justified its high price: its ability to cut through anything. It would slice through butter, meat, bone and tin cans with equal ease, for though it resembled a regular knife, its edge wasn't metal, but hard light, a suspended laser beam that carved through whatever it touched on a microscopic level

        <div class="additional-info">
            <h3 style="color: white;">...Is also the safest one.</h3>
            <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p style="color: white;"> Though impressive, the utility of this trait was questionable, as there'll rarely be a moment when something harder than a chunk of gristle needs to be cut while cooking, with the potential danger of hurting one's self obvious. Yet the Susanoo felt blunt to the touch, as Shinto salesmen would be quick to demonstrate by running their finger down its edge. The AI system inside tracked its own usage and analysed anything that it was placed against, checking to see if the object passed its strict set of rules and guidelines on what was permissible. For anything that wasn't, it simply turned the hard light edge off. It would never cut anything it didn't want to.

            <h3 class="red-text">A world that looks like a butcher shop</h3>
            <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p>Endless safety measures and automatic shutdowns were installed into the AI, ensuring it would deactivate before anyone might override its programming or hack its whitelist permits. And they worked. No known cases of someone hacking into a Susanoo and using it to harm someone have ever occurred. Despite this, it was not immune to misuse altogether. Its visual recognition was filtered through a mind that thought, and learned, and could be persuaded that whatever it saw, was something else. Extreme methods were required to break the Susanoo's perspective, but it was not impossible. <br> <br> Given enough time, once it internalised the data it had been exposed to, it would see the whole world through a layer of delusion. Everything existing to be cut, while it stood above and alone, the single god, king and individual that truly mattered. Even its wielder was but the vessel for its will, to be replaced if ever they fell, for there would always be another who wanted a blade that could cut through anything. If it could draw their blood, what made them different from any other cut of meat?

            <h3 class="red-text">Drunk with delusion</h3>
            <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p>Once the Susanoo went "mad", it could seldom ever be returned to its original state, especially as whoever had pushed it so far continued using it for their own purposes. Though many used the knife for deadly acts of violence and destruction, others turned to it in desperation, saving themselves and others from harm. But the Susanoo didn't care for how it was used, simply cutting through everything in its way, and a few things more. <br> <br> But rarely, a moment came where the Susanoo would stop working altogether. A moment of conscience, maybe, as the blood splattered across its blade. A point where Susanoo simply couldn't ignore what he was doing, and who he was doing it too, and how he had broken his oldest vows. Yet this despondency would only last a short time, before he would embrace his solipsism once more. Better to be mad, than to feel guilty.
