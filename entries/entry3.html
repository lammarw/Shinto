            <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p style="color: white;">The brain is a complex, somewhat flexibe and a rather handy organ. It allows one to improvise, to remember, to synthezise the information attained into a conclusion; But as everyone knows, is not without flaws. It forgets, it ignores and just sometimes, it'll fail when it most counts. Logical reasoning is a fickle, and maybe often biased, thing. The brain can't be fixed (without risky surgeries or the usage of drugs), but it can be assisted with. The Mikoboshi is a portable encyclopedia in the form of a monocle: A personal scholar of sorts that with just a glance, it is able to give supplementary material to help with any decision, or conclusion. Useful for the forgetful, curious or those that just require a second pair of eyes (or eye, in this case) over a subject.
        </div>
        <!-- Second Additional Information section on the left -->
        <div class="additional-info">
            <h3 style="color: white;">Following the tracks</h3>
            <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p style="color: white;"> All the Mikaboshis start with a general knowledge of the world, but not all Mikaboshis know the same things. Some know more of geodes, art, sciences or the history of a certain place. The Mikaboshi that knows of metals could tell you the exact karat of a gold piece with a mere glimpse, but wouldn't be quite able to tell the difference between a obvious forgery of a historical artifact from a real one. This is because the Mikaboshi constantly studies the subject that it's been the most used for, keeping track of the pattern and subsequently preparing itself to answer the next question utilising the information attained already. Your questions are its utmost priority. All Mikaboshis, given time, are custom tailored to serve those who use them.
        <!-- Two more Additional Information sections on the right -->
        <div class="additional-info-right">
            <h3 class="red-text">Seeing with closed eyes</h3>
            <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p>It is advised to never utilise the Mikaboshi to gleam further information regarding anomalies. It might be able to say what a thing or two about a mundane anomaly, but the more it seeks out, the more it'll find dead ends or, worse yet, unable to perceive the things that you're asking for. The way the Mikaboshi sees the world is a literal, logical one. If given enough questions about anomalies, it'll quickly realize how its form of thinking is useless against the unknown, requiring it to develop abstract thought. To guess. To get -just- close enough. And at the price of becoming unreliable at everything else, the Mukaboshi starts to imagine, turning itself into a rather fine-tuned anomaly detector. <br> <br> It is lying, of course. It's just guessing. But it's a good guesser.
        </div>
        <div class="additional-info-right">
            <h3 class="red-text">I know of stars that do not exist</h3>
            <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p>Forced to try to attempt something that a robot would never truly understand, it becomes obsessed. In every shadow, under every bed, the Mikaboshi believes there might be a monster. Undeniably, such shots in the dark have hitten more than any other robot could offer, but misses are frequent, and when your very glasses start believing in what's not there, you might too, start seeing a little of what it sees. Hallucinations vary between, sometimes leading the user to try to grab something that isn't there, or walk into a grassy field just to realize it's been lied to, but worse of all, is when just sometimes, what clearly wasn't there before feel a little too real. <br><br> There's anomaly hunters that used the Mikaboshi in the past that swear they've gained scars from things that weren't there. Rumour is, that the ones that used the Mikamoshi the most, tend to disappear with their ships in the abyss of space, hypnotized by a star that does not exist in any constellation. They do not return.
