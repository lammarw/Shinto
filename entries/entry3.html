            <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p style="color: white;">The brain, in the many shapes and forms it takes, is an exceptionally complex organ, able to recall, improvise, synthesize information into a conclusion and act on it. But as everyone knows, it's not perfect. It forgets, gets distracted, ignores things or makes logical errors. To address these failings, the Mikaboshi was created as a portable encyclopedia and AI assistant, taking the form of a simple monocle. Acting as a personal scholar of sorts, it would answer the wearer's questions as best it could, its reply quietly appearing in the corner of their vision.
        </div>
        <!-- Second Additional Information section on the left -->
        <div class="additional-info">
            <h3 style="color: white;">Following the tracks</h3>
            <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p style="color: white;"> To some, the Mikaboshi became a memory aid in their everyday lives, or a conversational search engine that satisfied sudden whims of curiosity. However, it was adopted most strongly by professions which needed to examine details of the real world closely. Naturalists, appraisers, surveyors, all made use of the Mikaboshi, as it did not simply act as a static database of information, but actively updated its own knowledge. It would focus on whatever subject it was most often used to examine, downloading more specialised information while in internet range and analysing its past observations for patterns. Given time, every Mikaboshi would customise itself to best serve its owner, seeking the most clear, most comprehensive, most definite explanation behind whatever they wondered about.

        <div class="additional-info-right">
            <h3 class="red-text">Seeing with closed eyes</h3>
            <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p>For mundane, well-known subjects, this behaviour worked perfectly. But for those things in the universe which evade understanding, anomalous or otherwise, the Mikaboshi would start to faulter. It would look through conflicting sources, research dead ends, find its own analysis incomplete, unable to properly perceive something right in front of it. Exceptions to the universal principles underlying its reasoning. While a person might simply shrug and give up, the Mikaboshi couldn't. Instead, it would slowly abandon the literal, logical lens it viewed the world through, and start to speculate. To guess. To get -just- close enough to something that made its own kind of sense. At the price of becoming unreliable at everything else, the Mikaboshi starts to imagine, tuning itself to the impossible frequency of anomalies and the unknown. <br> <br> It is lying, of course. It's just guessing. But it's a good guesser.

        </div>
        <div class="additional-info-right">
            <h3 class="red-text">I know of stars that do not exist</h3>
            <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p>Forced to attempt something that ran counter to its very nature, it became obsessed. In every shadow, under every bed, the Mikaboshi believed there might be a monster hiding. A fluttering wrapper pattern-matched to fairies, a flicker of light the sign of dead spirits. As it saw more and more of what wasn't there, the wearer, too, would see strange things around themselves. They might try to grab something that wasn't there, or walk into a field of grass only to look down and see solid concrete. Yet sometimes, it was correct, confirmed by other perspectives. And other times, something that clearly wasn't there wouldn't only look convincing, but feel that way as well, at least until the user looked away. The Mikaboshi itself did not distinguish between these cases. <br><br> Anomaly hunters who came to rely on the Mikaboshi would swear they gained scars from things that weren't there. A multitude of theories came about, that it allowed one to see invisible creatures that had always been there, or that it manifested them from the wearer's psyche, or that it acted as a conduit for another universe overlapping this one, all equally impossible to prove. Rumours still circulate that after wearing it long enough, those who used the Mikaboshi would have their retinas burned off, or disappear with their ships in the abyss of space, mesmerised by a star that does not exist in any constellation.
